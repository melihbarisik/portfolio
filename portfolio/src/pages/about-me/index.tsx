                <p>As a frontend developer, I have worked on various projects using React and Angular for the past 3 years. Creating user-centered, interactive, and efficient applications is a great passion of mine. Currently, I am developing modern web applications using Next.js 15 and React 19 technologies.</p>

                <p>I completed my education in Computer Engineering at Sakarya University. During this time, I received a year of foreign language education and spent half a semester in Poland as an exchange student. This experience was both fun and enriching for me.</p>

                <p>In both my professional work and personal projects, I gained experience with authentication systems like Keycloak. I have in-depth knowledge of developing secure and scalable applications. In various projects, I have provided solutions to ensure easy login for users and data security.</p>
